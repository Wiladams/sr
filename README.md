# sr
Simple Runner (sr)

This is the home of code that starts with core CS concepts, and works up from there.

The /junk directory is full of junk. Just bits and bobs of code dragged in from many
different sources.  Not particularly interesting.

The /lessons directory contains code that is to be consumed one week at a time.  The earliest weeks concern themselves with the basics of numerical representation, and then grow from there.

By week5, the code supports putting graphics in a window on the screen and interacting with it with mouse and keyboard events.

Each snippet of code is meant to be compiled simply with the Windows C/C++ compiler (cl), and does not depend on any libraries that are not already on a typical Windows system.
