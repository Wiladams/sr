/*
	This file is essentially a database of Windows messages.
	There are the standard reserved messages, those below 0x0400,
	and there are various other messages, that have become common
	by one means or another.

	For the most part the messages are taken from WinUser.h, which 
	defines them.  The ones in this file cover all Windows releases.

	The database has a 'reverse lookup' feature, which can be used to turn
	code into a string.  simply use:
		local msgs = require("wmmsgs")
		local name = msgs[0x0007],
		
		// name == 'WM_SETFOCUS'
